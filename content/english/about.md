## Hello World! üëãüèª
Welcome to my blog!  
I am Francesco known as **Airscript** on the web.  

Since I was a kid I've demonstrated a strong curiosity for what surrounded 
me: videogames, sports, cinematography.  
Just to name a few of the thousand things that fascinate me.  

Oh yes! I cannot miss out an honorable mention to paleonthology and 
specifically to **dinosaurs**.  
*Just between us I hadn't really forgotten them, I wanted them to have the 
attention they deserve.*  

Of all, however, computer science was the one I never lost sight of.  
The possibility of being able to create tools that could make people's life better through lines of code, got me so excited to make this interest, 
**passion** and later also **work**.  

I currently work as a Software Engineer for a beautiful startup called 
[hlpy](https://hlpy.co).  
Being able to contribuite to a project with a similar impact, makes me 
extremely satisfied and happy.  

But hey, introductions aside, let me explain what leads me to write on 
this blog.  

## Why a blog?
During 2022 I've decided to expose me publicly because I wanted to confront 
myself with other professionals in the sector.  
The reason? I have known [Progetto Happiness](https://progettohappiness.com/en/the-project/).  

If you didn't know Progetto Happiness, it is an initiative aimed to 
understanding what it is and how you can reach the **happiness** through a 
series of questions addressed to incredible people.  

So here I am!  
I too, like Giuseppe of the Project, would like to share with the whole 
world all the beauty that people that I know and interact with every day give me.

During this year I've got an invaluable value from these experiences and I 
want to share them with you.  

## What can I read?
As a great computer science enthusiast it seems absolutely obvious 
to me that the main topic will be that. I will treat it, however, in my own way.  

How? I'll put in a pinch of **philosophy** and **simplicity**: like those that distinguish me.  

Beyond this, I'd like to build a bond with whoever reads what I write.  
So expect to find totally generic articles, from time to time, about what 
happens during my daily adventures.  

## To whom it is addressed?
This blog is aimed to anyone looking for a different point of view, to 
anyone who wants to question themselves or just learn something new.  

Sure, okay, even if you want to find out why my name is `airscript`.  

## Where can I find you?
If you want to follow my adventures I'll leave some useful links below.  

But before that, I remind you that this blog is **entirely Open Source**.  
This means that you can contribute to both its development and the drafting 
of articles, get inspiration and much more.
